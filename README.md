Troll-Talk
==========

The Troll Talk program allows you to alter any text with one of twelve preset options, or create your own custom alterations.
To run the program, you must first install it. This is done by running the included "setup.exe" file. This will install the necessary components required to run the program. After they are installed the program will appear and you may access it at anytime from the start menu or the "Troll Talk.application" file.
